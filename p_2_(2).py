# Assigning the messy text to a variable
messy_text = " Python programming is fun! "

# Remove all the extra spaces at the beginning and end

# Replace "fun" with "amazing"
replaced_text = cleaned_text.replace("fun", "amazing")

(''' Explanation:
- `strip()` removes the leading and trailing spaces from the string.
- `replace("fun", "amazing")` replaces the word "fun" with "amazing".
- `count('i')` counts how many times the letter 'i' appears in the string.
